======

Scenario / map generator for [Freeciv](http://freeciv.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page)
written entierly in JavaScript. It uses lsystems, some code is reused from
[lsys](https://github.com/morphles/lsys).

For now it is pretty limitted, and uses only older code from lsys. It only
generated heightmap, and according to it places ether deserts grasslands,
mountains or hills. Some time in a future humidity map should be generated
along with temperature map, and that should allow better terrain selection.
